A collection of data gathered of player's input delay with Parsec and Cloud PCs. 

READ ME from @Jason_Gamedev
1. Further distance you are from the source, the higher input delay you will have. 
If you have gigabit internet, you'll reduce you're input delay by at least 2Fs compared to non-gigabit internet.

2. The less download speed you have and weaker machine you're running, the more likely you'll expierence frame drops/skips

Each page refers to where the Instance is being launched from. If it doesn't say Google, it's AWS. 
So that is where me and the other player connects to.
