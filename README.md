A collection of data gathered of player's input delay with Parsec and Cloud PCs. Contact me on Jason_Gamedev if you wanna contribute anything or have any questions! 


Each page refers to where the Instance is being launched from. So that is where the player connects to.

General trends I've noticed while testing. 

1. Further distance you are from the source, the higher input delay you will have. 
If you have gigabit internet, you'll reduce your input delay by at least 2Fs compared to non-gigabit internet.

2. The less download speed you have and weaker machine you're running, the more likely you'll expierence frame drops/skips


Big thanks to @dathazy for teaching me how to setup AWS and Google Cloud Instances, and Kevin Ha for starting the idea of using Parsec with Cloud PCs!
