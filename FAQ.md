Q: What's the purpose of using Cloud PCs rather than just using your normal PC?

A: To avoid host advantage where the host is basically playing the game with 0 input delay while the client is playing with input delay. Also the host's upload speed might not be strong enough to host.


Q: Why go through all this trouble and instead use the game's base netcode?

A: Many fighting games use delay based netcode which has been notoriously bad for the player's expierence. With this setup players are able to get usually consistent input delay with little worry of it fluctuating. Some issues may occur with dropping/skipping frames which is related to your PC specs and/or download speed since it is a video stream.    


Q: Do I need to own the game to use with Parsec?

A: If you are hosting yes. If you are connecting to someone then they're the ones that need to own the game.
