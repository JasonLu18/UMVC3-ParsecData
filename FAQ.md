# FAQS



Q: What is Parsec? 

A: Parsec is a desktop capturing application primarily used for cloud-based gaming through video streaming. 


Q: Is Parsec free?

A: Yes, it is free to download [here](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads/)


Q: What's the purpose of using Cloud PCs rather than just using your normal PC?

A: To avoid host advantage where the host is basically playing the game with 0 input delay while the client is playing with input delay. Also the host's upload speed might not be strong enough to host.


Q: Why go through all this trouble and instead use the game's base netcode?

A: Many fighting games use delay based netcode which has been notoriously bad for the player's experience. With this setup players are able to get usually consistent input delay with little worry of it fluctuating. Some issues may occur with dropping/skipping frames which is related to your PC specs and/or download speed since it is a video stream.    


Q: Do I need to own the game to use with Parsec?

A: If you are hosting yes. If you are connecting to someone then they're the ones that need to own the game.


Q: Are Cloud PCs free?

A: No, Amazon Webservices, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure all cost money.


Q: Which service do you reccomend? 


A: It depends on your location and preferences. Google Cloud has the same areas as AWS but also has Iowa and LA, while Azure has Texas. Google Cloud has had a few stability issues with certain people. Google Cloud offers $300 credit for 1 year use on a brand new account while Azure offers $200 credit for 1 month use, AWS has no known free trial offers. 


Q: How do I set up a Cloud PC?


A: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLyTBHJY7jM) is a tutorial by [datHazy](https://twitter.com/datHazy)  for AWS. Other tutorials exist on Azure/Google Cloud with near identical steps on youtube. Once you figure out how to setup one, you should be able to figure out the other services easily. 


Q: I see something about reducing the costs, what is that about?


A: With these services they have spot/preemptible instances which usually cost 1/2 the price of on demand instances. But they usually have some sort of restriction attached depending on the service.
